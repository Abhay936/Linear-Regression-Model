# Linear Regression on California Housing Dataset

This repository contains a Python project that demonstrates training a **Linear Regression model** on the California Housing dataset to predict house prices.

## 📋 Project Overview

The California Housing dataset contains data collected from the 1990 California census. The dataset includes features such as:

- `MedInc`: Median income in block group
- `HouseAge`: Median house age in block group
- `AveRooms`: Average number of rooms per household
- `AveBedrms`: Average number of bedrooms per household
- `Population`: Block group population
- `AveOccup`: Average number of household members
- `Latitude` and `Longitude`: Geographical coordinates

The goal of this project is to predict the **median house value (`MedHouseVal`)** based on these features using a Linear Regression model.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn (`LinearRegression`, `train_test_split`, `metrics`)  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization, optional)
